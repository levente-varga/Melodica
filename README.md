# Melodica
 
A rhythm game in development, made in Godot.

## Description

This project is a proof of concept, meaning that it is not a full game (yet), but something like a demo version. It contains a tutorial of the basic controls and gameplay elements, a fully functioning menu system, and fun on-beat animations made possible by the precisely smoothened music player position.

The project is updated regularly - hence the short readme - and code documentation is in the works.

Made in Godot 4.2.1 (.NET)
